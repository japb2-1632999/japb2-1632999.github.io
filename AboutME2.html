<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> 	My name is John Angelo Bernal and I am the oldest child of three children, my two younger sisters and me. I was born in Coos Bay, Oregon and moved up to Washington, specifically Puyallup, when I was around 3 or 4 years old. I went to high school at Bellarmine Prep in Tacoma and graduated in 2016.
<p> 	I love playing and watching baseball, and of course, I'm a Mariners fan. I've played baseball since I was a kid and miss it very much. Now that I am in college, it's hard to find time to play. I miss it sometimes.
